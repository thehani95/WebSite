<h1>Small Blue Butterfly</h1>

<p>
Despite the name, Small Blue butterflies (Cupido minimus) are not really blue in color. Males and females usually have dark brown or greyish wings, with small specks of blue. Their wingspans are only 0.79 to 1.18 inches (20 to 30 mm), making them easy to overlook. These butterflies prefer to perch on grass blades, mainly in warm chalk grasslands in England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Small Blue butterflies are not endangered, but due to declining numbers and habitats, they now become priorities in conservation programs.

<h1>Geranium Bronze</h1>

<p>
Geranium Bronze (Cacyreus marshalli) is a native butterfly of South Africa. They have bronze or brown wings with simple white linings on the top. The bottom parts of the wings have more intricate patterns, with net-like white and dark lines. They have two eye-like patterns on the hindwings, which they use to confuse predators. Their wingspans range from 0.7 to 0.9 inches (18 to 23 mm). Geranium Bronze was introduced to Europe in the 70’s, but now, they are considered pests for geranium and pelargonium flowers.
